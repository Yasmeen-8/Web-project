        <p> <b> For students: </b> <br>
        Finding motivation to study shouldn’t be your focus, try disciplining yourself <br>
        into having a steady study schedule and time to make sure you’re up to date with<br>
        your subjects and lessons and avoid cramming before an exam. First know your style<br>
        are you the type to study before relaxing? For example, you must finish all your<br>
        homework before indulging in someone fun like movies or Video games and other<br>
        activities. Well, its recommended after your day in uni or during the weekends<br>
        an early study time before doing anything fun, but if you’re the opposite!<br>
        Try doing the fun stuff and relax in the morning or after uni and then at<br>
        night 2-4 hours before sleep pull out your iPad, laptop or books to study<br>
        and do your homework. A lot of people would say the second part is invalid<br>
        and can cause people to be lazy but know that you’re valid and as long as<br>
        you at least study you’re doing amazing no matter what time works for you.<br>
        The main tip! Remove your phone, no limits no nothing just put your phone away<br>
        from your desk. Have a certain space for studying! The desk you have your computer<br>
        on and play video games? No good you need a dedicated study area it helps your<br>
        brain get into the study zone. Practice taking short breaks between sessions,<br>
        like using the pomodoro timer if it works for you. Set small realistic Goals<br>
        like studying one or 2 lessons and one homework. Remember to work out and move!<br>
        Keep your body busy with an activity it will make you more energized to study<br>
        and help you focus, improve your discipline by setting a time for a 10 min<br>
        workout every day, it doesn’t have to be a lot and especially not reliant<br>
        on your motivation! <br>
