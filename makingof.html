        <h1>Making of Student Sanctuary</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 30px;">
            The journey of creating Student Sanctuary began with a vision to provide a supportive platform for students at Bahrain Polytechnic. Our team, consisting of dedicated individuals passionate about mental health and academic success, collaborated to design a website that addresses the unique challenges faced by students. We conducted extensive research to identify the resources and features that would be most beneficial, including forums for peer support, mental health resources, and academic tips. Throughout the development process, we prioritized user experience, ensuring that the site is easy to navigate and visually appealing. We also sought feedback from fellow students to refine our offerings and ensure that Student Sanctuary truly meets their needs. The result is a comprehensive platform that fosters community, promotes well-being, and supports academic achievement.

    <h2> Home Page </h2>
    <p>The Home page introduces the purpose of the Student Sanctuary website and welcomes visitors in a friendly and supportive way. It clearly explains that the site aims to provide academic guidance, mental-health resources, and a sense of community for students who may feel overwhelmed or stressed. The design of the Home page is simple and easy to navigate, which makes the message stand out without distracting the user. The welcoming image and short introduction help create an encouraging first impression, and the “Try Form Now” button gives users a clear next step. This layout works well because it follows basic design principles such as clarity, simplicity, and strong visual hierarchy, which help users quickly understand what the site offers.</p>

    <h2> Form Page </h2>
    <p>The Form page is designed to gather feedback from students about their mental health and academic experiences. It features a straightforward survey format with a mix of multiple-choice questions and open-ended responses, allowing students to share their thoughts in different ways. The questions are relevant and focused on key areas such as stress levels, coping strategies, and the availability of support services. The layout is clean and organized, making it easy for users to read and respond to each question without feeling overwhelmed. By providing a simple and accessible way for students to express their needs and concerns, the Form page effectively supports the website's goal of fostering a supportive community.</p>

    <h2> Resources Page </h2>
    <p> The Resources page provides helpful external links, mainly videos, that address topics such as burnout, studying while dealing with mental-health difficulties, and long-term mental-health management. Including video resources is effective because many students learn better through visual content, and it makes the site feel more supportive and interactive. The layout is clean, with each resource placed in a clear section, which makes it easy for students to choose what they want to view. This page works well because it adds value to the site and supports students by giving them access to trusted external materials.</p>

    <h2> tips page </h2>
    <p> The Tips page is designed to give students practical advice that can help them manage their academic workload or improve their mental well-being. Although the content is straightforward, the purpose of the page is important because students often need simple strategies they can apply right away. The organized layout makes the information easy to read, and the clean design helps students focus on the advice without feeling overwhelmed. This page demonstrates good design by keeping information clearly separated, using headings to guide the reader, and maintaining consistency with the rest of the site.</p>

    <h2> About Us Page </h2>
    <p> The About Us page explains the purpose behind the Student Sanctuary website and gives users a better understanding of who created it and why. This page is important because it helps build trust and shows that the site was created with the intention of supporting students. A clear explanation of the mission helps visitors feel more connected to the platform. The simple design and organized layout also make it easy to read, which supports the overall professional and consistent tone of the website.</p>
