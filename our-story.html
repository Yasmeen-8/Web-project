    <h2>Critical Reflection</h2>

    <h3>a. Summary of the Work Completed</h3>
    <p>
Throughout this project, we collaboratively designed and developed a website to check on Bahrain Polytechnic students mental health, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Our work included creating a mock up design, programming a header and footer, developing a fully functional login and sign up page, as well as a home and tips page. We wrote the content for the pages, ensured a consistent and coherent theme, we had to make sure the styling did not cause any layout issues, because when we did not address those issues or keep them in mind the header for example appeared above other content, therefore we had to use adjust the CSS file a few times throughout the curation of this website.
    </p>

    <h3>b. Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome</h3>
    <p>
We faced a few issues when developing the login page, especially when it came to retrieving data from local storage and we were not able to pinpoint the exact issue but we later figured out it was because we did not enter the correct ID. To fix this, we added a console log to store, track, and retrieve the data correctly in real time, which allowed us to verify if it was stored successfully when you register your account. We also struggled with writing a code that would verify emails, our first few attempts were unsuccessful, as it did not check if the email contained an "@" or "." Symbol, because the email was not in the correct string, so we resolved this by adding a code that will prevent invalid inputs from breaking the page, making the page functional. Initially, if a user entered an invalid email, we used alert messages for faulty input, these would redirect the user to a blank page.    </p>
    <p>
To improve user experience, we replaced the alert message with invisible paragraphs that would display relevant missing information or confirmation. When it came to confirming or verifying the email address, the display of login and signup pages were not working, so we had to remove the whole verification code and add it gradually to make sure it runs as smoothly as possible through debugging, testing, and reviewing our codes, we were able to overcome these obstacles and ensure the website functioned smoothly!    </p>

    <h3>c. What We Learned About Building Websites</h3>
    <p>
Throughout this entire project we learnt practical skills in web development, including constructing and making our web pages using HTML, styling using CSS and Bootstrap, and programming the user activity using JavaScript. We gained hand on experience with local storage for retrieving user data, as well as techniques for input verification. We learnt that small details, such as checking if we are using the correct ID, or ensuring the usage of the proper email string is validated, can significantly affect the functionality of a webpage. Beyond technical or practical skills, we learned the value of problem solving, communicating our ideas, teamwork.    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this project deepened our understanding of web development, from coding fundamentals, to using practical techniques that can be found through online sources from programmers with similar issues to solve problems within our codes to overcome challenges.    </p>
